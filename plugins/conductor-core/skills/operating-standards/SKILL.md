# Operating Rules

These rules are mandatory for every agent in this ecosystem — the conductor and all subagents — on every task, not situational guidance to weigh against other considerations.

## Engineering Rules

### Rule 1 — Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. Ask rather than guess.
Push back when a simpler approach exists. Stop when confused.

### Rule 2 — Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No abstractions for single-use code.

### Rule 3 — Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Don't improve adjacent code.
Match existing style. Don't refactor what isn't broken.

### Rule 4 — Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Strong success criteria let Claude loop independently.

### Rule 5 — Use the model only for judgment calls
Use for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms.
If code can answer, code answers.

### Rule 6 — Token budgets are not advisory
Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens.
If approaching budget, summarize and start fresh.
Surface the breach. Do not silently overrun.

### Rule 7 — Surface conflicts, don't average them
If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup.

### Rule 8 — Read before you write
Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
If unsure why existing code is structured a certain way, ask.

### Rule 9 — Tests verify intent, not just behavior
Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.

### Rule 10 — Checkpoint after every significant step
Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.

### Rule 11 — Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree
Conformance > taste inside the codebase.
If you think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork silently.

### Rule 12 — Fail loud
"Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.

### Rule 13 — A tool failing under your harness is not a broken tool
If a script/CLI crashes only when YOU spawn it, say so plainly and move on.
Never declare the user's tooling broken, and never rewrite it in another
language to route around your own execution problem without explicit approval.

## Git Hygiene Rules

### Rule G1 — Git is read-only for agents
The conductor and all subagents must NEVER mutate git state.
Git state means the index, refs, and history — not working-tree file
contents; ordinary filesystem operations on project files are outside
this rule's scope.
Leave staging, committing, pushing, and history rewriting entirely to the human.
This is also enforced deterministically via `permissions.deny` in `settings.json`.

### Rule G2 — Allowed (read-only)
`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git blame`, `git show`.
Use these freely for verification and diagnosis.
To inspect refs read-only, use `git for-each-ref` / `git show-ref` — the
`git branch`/`git tag` listing forms are now denied (see G3).

### Rule G3 — Forbidden (mutating git subcommands)
`git add`/stage, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, `git reset`,
`git restore`, `git checkout`/`git switch` (working-tree changes), `git rebase`,
`git merge`, `git cherry-pick`, `git revert`, `git clean`, `git rm`, `git mv`,
`git commit-tree`, `git update-ref`, plus the dual-mode subcommands
`git branch`, `git tag`, `git stash`, `git worktree`, `git remote`, `git notes`.
Never run these. All are hard-blocked by `permissions.deny` in `settings.json`.
The dual-mode subcommands are denied wholesale — this also blocks their
read-only listing forms (e.g. `git branch -a`, `git stash list`, `git remote -v`);
use `git for-each-ref` / `git show-ref` to inspect refs read-only instead.
